Example code for Workers workshop, creating a KV-powered Todos App with modern Workers tooling: Wrangler 2, module workers.

This branch is "vanilla" Workers: for a condensed, "what-I-recommend" approach, check out the [`hono` branch](https://github.com/codewithkristian/wm-workshop/tree/a06a7e05eaa5568c08eb469c1dd94e29c68f2fc0), which uses the Hono framework for better DX.
